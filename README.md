# The Static File Hoster (static_file_hoster)

This is a bucket for files I want to quickly host, and have online access to.

I needed to "fetch"/curl a text file to use for a quick demo of an npm library. 
Figured I'd use the "raw" link, as an easy way to host static files

Nifty, I think. I recommend same.

Until a service comes and disrupts this, it's the best we've got.

If you also think this is a good idea, which the Internet needs, and would like
to join forces to make this happen, do email me a meyian [@] gmail.com, and let's
make it happen!
